# Search Talon Commands Extension Announcement

New Extension: **Search Talon Commands for VS Code**

Iâ€™ve just released a new VS Code extension: **Search Talon Commands**.

Instantly search and browse your Talon Voice commands and lists with advanced filtering, lightning-fast performance, and a modern UI.

**Features include:**
- In-memory JSON search for massive datasets
- Multi-dimensional filters (app, mode, repo, tags, OS, title)
- Dedicated tabbed interface for commands, lists, and some captures
- Responsive, modern design

**File Access Policy:** The extension only reads Talon files (.talon, .talon-list, .py) and never writes or modifies your data.

You can find it on the VS Code Marketplace:
